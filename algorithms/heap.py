class Heap:
    """
    This is a heap implementation that uses an array. Since a heap is an as-complete-as-possible binary tree,
    the parent and children of any given key in the heap can be found by simple arithmetic.
    For example, let's say we have the following heap:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          / \
         4   5

    We can represent the heap as the array:
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    The parent of key 5 can be found by taken the floor of the key's position divided by 2.
    5 // 2 = 2

    Similarly, the children of key 2 can be found by multiplying the key's position and adding 1.
    2 * 2 = 4
    2 * 2 + 1 = 5
