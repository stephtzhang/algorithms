    for a given edge_list representing an undirected graph,
    return an edge_list representing the minimum spanning tree (mst) for the input graph.

    the input edge_list should consist of tuples as follows: (node_a, node_b, edge_weight).
    for example, the graph below:
              a
          5  / \  1
            /   \
           b --- c
             2

    should be represented by the edge_list:
    [('a', 'b', 5), ('a', 'c', 1), ('b', 'c', 2)]

    where the node order doesn't matter, since this is an undirected graph.

    an mst is the tree with the lowest summed edge weights that connects all a graph's nodes.
    for example, we would expect this mst to be returned for the input graph above:
    [('a', 'c', 1), ('b', 'c', 2)]
